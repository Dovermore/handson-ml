1.
    SVC: Not only separate different class of instances but also try to keep the separation as far away as possible from the margin of both classes with support vectors
    SVR: Fit the line through data sets and keep as much instances inside the margin as possible
    
2.
    The points on the margin that determines where margin is
    possibly also the points that violates margin.
    
3.
    SVMs are sensitive to scales. Scale the inputs can significantly impove the performance by widen the street.
    If the instance is not scaled the vector tend to neglect small features!!!!
    
4.
    No, it only output the result.
    Neither

5.
    Primal.
    Dual is when training instance is more than training features

6.
    Should try increase both gamma and C to reduce the regularization effect and get more complex fitted model
