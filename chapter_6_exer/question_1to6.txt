1.
    log(N+1)-1

2.
    Lower.
    Always.
    cuz weight left * gini left + weight right * gini right

3.
    Yes.
    Reduce max_* or incrase min_* will have regularization effect on the model

4.
    No. Decision tree is insensitive to feature scales
    
5.
    Training time is porpotion to nmlog(m).
    So the time is roughly 11.667hrs
    
6.
    It only speeds up small set of data. So no.
